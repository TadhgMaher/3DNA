Best thing we got in the house was this amazing 3D Model of our home. Super work Dylan, has the pride of place in our living room. My model is one of my praised possessions.One of the nicest personalized items we own. We love showing it off pride of place on display in our new home..

Dylan has produced an outstanding model of our home based on the planning application drawings. The model is of great quality and detail. The model captured some of the main design aspects of the project.
Joseph
Co. Kilkenny
The quality of the product and attention to detail is exceptional. Dylan was extremely responsive and was very helpful making some changes not on the original drawing in to the design.
Bríd
Co. Cork
The service provided was extremely professional, there was constant feedback on the model prior to printing with 3D visuals to ensure that we were all on the same page.  I would highly recommend this to all my friends and work colleagues - an excellent way to visualize a project
John O’ Callaghan
Co. Cork
We received the 3D model.  The only issue we have with it is we want to move in!!  It's amazing.  We're totally delighted with it & hopefully the real house will look as good when it gets built.  I have already given my brother your company details as he is planning a renovation on his own house for next year.
